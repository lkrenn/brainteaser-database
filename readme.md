# Brainteaser Database

The quant world is flush with talent, and it is therefore hard for companies to hand pick the best candidates for the role. Therefore, companies rely on filters which often times flush out good candidates, but still retain lots of quality candidates. Some examples of these filters are prestige of university, prestige of work experience, and numeracy skills.

The point of this repo is to answer some questions that I either found puzzing, fun to solve, or just bread-and-butter interview questions that I've experienced myself, or through contacts. 

If you found this, I hope you also find some use out of these questions, and remember: often times interviewers couldn't answer the brainteasers they themselves ask. There is always some luck involved in quant interviews. Good luck!
